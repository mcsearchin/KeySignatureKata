KeySignatureKata
================

My first kata in C++ -- I made this one up.  Most of the testing is around getting the tonic for a key signature based on number of sharps/flats and tonality.

Some of the conventions are ugly, but I'm trying to adhere to the practices of the project I'm on right now.
